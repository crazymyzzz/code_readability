Bump elasticsearch client version to 6.8.23

The newer version addresses some critical CVEs and fixes some bugs
regarding retry of failed requests being routed to dead hosts. It also
makes the client work with ES 6.7 which had a breaking change causing
older clients to not work with it in some cases.

Elasticsearch clients are forward compatible and only guaranteed to work
with servers with matching major versions. i.e. 6.8.23 client would work
with 6.8.x and newer servers only. This also changes the
TestElasticsearch6ConnectorTest to use 6.6.0 version for tests since
that's the oldest version against which the connector passes all tests.

This also adds comments explaining why an exclusion exists and also
removes those that are no longer required - reducing the chances that
someone runs into runtime errors if they do something which we don't
explicitly test.

Two new explicit dependencies on org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-core
and org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch-x-content are added because some
classes from org.elasticsearch.common package were moved into separate
modules.
