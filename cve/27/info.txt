Bump Airbase to 126

* Version 125 brings (among other things) updated dependency on Jackson,
  which fixes at least one CVE. Dependency on snakeyaml needs to be
  bumped to avoid conflicts with transitive dependencies.

* Version 126 brings fixes to how locale information is passed to Maven
  Surefire plugin. In relation to that, this commit adds a test to
  verify that the system locale is actually properly configured in the
  JVM.
